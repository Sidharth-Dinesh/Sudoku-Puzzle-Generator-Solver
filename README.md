# Sudoku-Puzzle-Generator-Solver

Using a recursive backtracking algorithm, a 'Sudoku-Puzzle-Generator-Solver' was implemented in Python 3.7.3.

Recursive backtracking is a highly useful algorithm for situations like these where a brute force
algorithm is usable but takes so long as to be impractical. Recursive backtracking is similar to brute
force, but allows for greater efficiency in exchange for stack space. Here, it was used both to
generate and solve the grid. However, it is somewhat tricky to understand and code as compared to
a brute force algorithm.
